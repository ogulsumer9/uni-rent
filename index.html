Welcome to the UniRent!
UniRent is a newly developed mobile platform that aims to bring you rental experience for university students and landlords in Turkey.
Our goal is to create a safe, transparent, and efficient rental environment tailored specifically for the needs of students and property owners.

For students, UniRent offers:

Verified rental listings to minimize scams and hidden costs,
Transparent & fixed pricing to avoid unexpected charges,
Roommate matching tools based on lifestyle preferences,
A student-only community, where only verified university students can rent and communicate.

For landlords, UniRent provides:
Affordable listing options without the need for expensive agency commissions,
Access to a verified pool of student tenants,
Promotion and analytics features to help rent out properties faster,
The ability to set custom rental rules (e.g., no pets, minimum stay periods) directly on the platform.

In this survey, you will be asked to imagine yourself in one of two roles:

As a landlord offering a property for rent,

Or as a student searching for housing.

Your responses will help us better understand the preferences, needs, and expectations of our future users.
Please answer honestly based on how you would feel about using such a platform.
Thank you for your time and valuable feedback!
